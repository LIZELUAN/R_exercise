__Rmd file__: Revised version R exercise solution  
__html file__: My original solution for R practise  

Some important hints:
- Remember to match the `sample_name list order` in the gene expression matrix  
            with the `sample_name list` of the clinical information of samples. 

- Use the variable name that has a meaning and readable, not random name
